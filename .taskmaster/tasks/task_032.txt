# Task ID: 32
# Title: Implement Public Holidays Endpoint
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 27
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a complete implementation of the Public Holidays endpoint following the Float API v3 specification, including listing public holidays, managing holiday calendar, and supporting multi-region holidays.
# Details:
Implementation completed successfully. Created comprehensive public holidays MCP tools in src/tools/public-holidays.ts with:

1. Added publicHolidaySchema to src/types/float.ts with proper Zod validation
2. Implemented 5 core tools: listPublicHolidays, getPublicHoliday, createPublicHoliday, updatePublicHoliday, deletePublicHoliday
3. Features include:
   - Date range filtering (start_date, end_date)
   - Multi-region support (region, country fields)
   - Holiday type support (moveable, recurring, fixed)
   - Full CRUD operations with proper error handling
   - Pagination support for listing
   - Proper Float API patterns following existing tools

4. Updated src/tools/index.ts to export all new tools
5. All builds and type checks pass successfully

The implementation follows Float API v3 conventions and established patterns from other tools in the codebase.

Public holiday schema structure:
```typescript
export const publicHolidaySchema = z.object({
  holiday_id: z.union([z.string(), z.number()]),
  name: z.string(),
  date: z.string(), // ISO date format
  region: z.string().nullable(),
  country: z.string().nullable(),
  type: z.string().optional(), // moveable, recurring, fixed
  // Additional fields from Float API
});
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit test each public holiday endpoint function with mocked API responses
2. Test CRUD operations for public holidays
3. Test date range filtering and pagination
4. Test region-specific filtering
5. Verify schema validation for holiday objects
6. Integration test with actual Float API in a test environment
7. Test multi-region holiday support

# Subtasks:
## 1. Create Public Holiday Schema and Types [completed]
### Dependencies: None

## 4. Update Tool Exports [completed]
### Dependencies: 32.2
### Description: Export all new public holiday tools in src/tools/index.ts for MCP server integration.
### Details:
Updated src/tools/index.ts to export all 5 public holiday tools, ensuring they are available for MCP server registration and client usage.

## 5. Validate Implementation and Build Process [completed]
### Dependencies: 32.3, 32.4
### Description: Ensure all implementations pass type checking and build validation.
### Details:
All builds and type checks pass successfully. Implementation follows Float API v3 conventions and established patterns from other tools in the codebase.

# Task ID: 42
# Title: Project Cleanup and Organization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 40, 41
# Priority: high
# Description: Clean up the codebase by removing temporary files, organizing project structure, and ensuring proper file organization with clear separation of concerns.
# Details:
Perform comprehensive project cleanup and organization tasks:

1. **Root Directory Cleanup**:
   - Remove temporary files (.tmp, .cache, node_modules if corrupted)
   - Clean up build artifacts and generated files
   - Remove unused configuration files
   - Organize root-level files into logical groups

2. **Source Code Organization**:
   - Review src/ directory structure for logical organization
   - Ensure proper separation of concerns (services, schemas, tests, utils)
   - Move misplaced files to appropriate directories
   - Create consistent naming conventions across all files

3. **Documentation Organization**:
   - Consolidate documentation files into docs/ directory
   - Organize API documentation by endpoint categories
   - Create clear README structure with proper sections
   - Ensure all documentation is up-to-date and consistent

4. **Test Structure Cleanup**:
   - Organize test files to mirror source structure
   - Separate unit tests, integration tests, and test utilities
   - Remove obsolete or duplicate test files
   - Ensure consistent test naming conventions

5. **Configuration Management**:
   - Review and organize configuration files
   - Remove unused dependencies from package.json
   - Clean up environment configuration files
   - Ensure proper .gitignore coverage

6. **Code Quality Improvements**:
   - Remove unused imports and dead code
   - Ensure consistent code formatting
   - Organize imports consistently across files
   - Remove commented-out code blocks

# Test Strategy:
1. **File Structure Validation**:
   - Verify all files are in appropriate directories
   - Check that no temporary or build files remain in repository
   - Validate consistent naming conventions across project

2. **Documentation Review**:
   - Ensure all documentation is accessible and well-organized
   - Verify README and API docs are current and complete
   - Check that documentation structure is logical and navigable

3. **Code Quality Checks**:
   - Run linting tools to ensure code consistency
   - Verify no unused imports or dead code remains
   - Check that all files follow established patterns

4. **Build and Test Verification**:
   - Ensure project builds successfully after cleanup
   - Run full test suite to verify no functionality was broken
   - Verify all dependencies are properly declared and used

5. **Repository Health Check**:
   - Review .gitignore effectiveness
   - Ensure no sensitive files are tracked
   - Verify clean git status after cleanup

6. **Developer Experience Validation**:
   - Test project setup from fresh clone
   - Verify development workflow still functions correctly
   - Ensure all scripts and commands work as expected

# Task ID: 44
# Title: Fix and Organize GitHub Workflows
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 41, 42
# Priority: medium
# Description: Review and fix the existing integration test workflow created by Claude Code, resolve any configuration issues, and create a simplified, reliable GitHub Actions CI/CD setup that works consistently without failures.
# Details:
Perform comprehensive GitHub Actions workflow cleanup and optimization:

1. **Review Existing Integration Test Workflow**:
   - Audit the current .github/workflows/ directory for existing workflows
   - Identify issues in the integration test workflow (timeouts, environment setup, API key handling)
   - Review workflow triggers, job dependencies, and step configurations
   - Check for proper secret management and environment variable setup

2. **Fix Integration Test Workflow Issues**:
   - Resolve authentication problems with Float API test credentials
   - Fix timeout issues by optimizing test execution and adding proper timeouts
   - Ensure proper Node.js version and dependency installation
   - Fix any matrix build configurations that may be causing instability
   - Implement proper error handling and failure reporting

3. **Create Simplified CI/CD Workflow**:
   ```yaml
   name: CI/CD Pipeline
   on:
     push:
       branches: [main, develop]
     pull_request:
       branches: [main]
   
   jobs:
     test:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4
         - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
           with:
             node-version: '18'
             cache: 'npm'
         - run: npm ci
         - run: npm run test
         - run: npm run test:integration
           env:
             FLOAT_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.FLOAT_API_KEY }}
   ```

4. **Workflow Organization**:
   - Separate concerns: unit tests, integration tests, linting, building
   - Implement proper caching strategies for dependencies
   - Add status badges and proper workflow naming
   - Configure proper branch protection rules
   - Remove redundant or broken workflows

5. **Environment and Secret Management**:
   - Document required repository secrets
   - Implement proper environment variable handling
   - Add fallback configurations for missing secrets
   - Ensure test isolation and cleanup

6. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Implement parallel job execution where appropriate
   - Optimize dependency installation with proper caching
   - Add conditional job execution to avoid unnecessary runs
   - Implement proper artifact handling for build outputs

# Test Strategy:
1. **Workflow Validation**:
   - Test all workflows locally using act or similar tools
   - Verify workflows trigger correctly on push/PR events
   - Ensure all jobs complete successfully without timeouts

2. **Integration Test Verification**:
   - Run integration tests in GitHub Actions environment
   - Verify Float API authentication works correctly
   - Test that all integration test suites pass consistently
   - Validate proper error reporting and failure handling

3. **CI/CD Pipeline Testing**:
   - Test the complete pipeline from code push to deployment
   - Verify proper secret handling and environment setup
   - Test matrix builds if implemented (different Node versions)
   - Ensure proper caching behavior and performance

4. **Branch Protection and PR Testing**:
   - Test that PR workflows run correctly and block merging on failures
   - Verify status checks are properly configured
   - Test that required workflows complete before merge
   - Validate proper permissions and access controls

5. **Documentation and Maintenance**:
   - Document all workflow configurations and requirements
   - Test workflow badge functionality in README
   - Verify all required secrets are documented
   - Ensure workflows are maintainable and well-commented

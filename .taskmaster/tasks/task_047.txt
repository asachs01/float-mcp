# Task ID: 47
# Title: Create Development and Contribution Guidelines
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 43, 40, 39, 41
# Priority: low
# Description: Establish clear development setup instructions, contribution guidelines, code style standards, and development workflow documentation for future contributors.
# Details:
Create comprehensive development and contribution documentation to enable smooth onboarding and collaboration. Implement the following documentation components:

1. **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Main contribution guide:
   - Development environment setup (Node.js, npm/yarn requirements)
   - Repository cloning and dependency installation
   - Environment configuration (API keys, test credentials)
   - Local development server setup
   - Testing procedures (unit, integration, linting)

2. **Development Workflow Documentation** (docs/development/):
   - Git workflow and branching strategy
   - Pull request process and review guidelines
   - Issue reporting and feature request templates
   - Release process and versioning
   - CI/CD pipeline documentation

3. **Code Style Standards** (docs/development/code-style.md):
   - TypeScript/JavaScript coding conventions
   - ESLint and Prettier configuration
   - File naming conventions
   - Code organization patterns
   - Documentation standards for functions and classes

4. **Development Setup Guide** (docs/development/setup.md):
   - Prerequisites and system requirements
   - IDE/editor recommendations and configurations
   - Debugging setup and techniques
   - Testing environment configuration
   - Common troubleshooting solutions

5. **Architecture Documentation** (docs/development/architecture.md):
   - Project structure overview
   - MCP integration patterns
   - Float API service architecture
   - Error handling patterns
   - Schema validation approach

Include GitHub templates for issues and pull requests, pre-commit hooks configuration, and automated code quality checks.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify development setup instructions work on clean environments (different OS)
2. Test that new contributors can successfully set up development environment
3. Validate all code examples and commands execute correctly
4. Check that style guide examples match actual project code patterns
5. Ensure GitHub templates render correctly and provide clear guidance
6. Test pre-commit hooks and automated quality checks function properly
7. Verify documentation links and references are accurate
8. Review contribution workflow with actual pull request simulation
9. Validate that troubleshooting guides address common setup issues
10. Ensure documentation stays current with project dependencies and tools

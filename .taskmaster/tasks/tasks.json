        "description": "Implement the complete MCP Streamable HTTP transport layer according to the 2025-03-26 specification, including HTTP POST/GET endpoints, Server-Sent Events streaming, session management, security features, and connection resumability.",
        "details": "This task involves implementing a comprehensive HTTP transport layer for the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that supports both traditional request-response patterns and streaming communication. Key implementation components include:\n\n1. **HTTP Endpoints**: Create POST endpoint for MCP requests and GET endpoint for establishing SSE connections. Implement proper content-type handling (application/json for requests, text/event-stream for SSE).\n\n2. **Server-Sent Events (SSE) Streaming**: Implement SSE protocol for real-time bidirectional communication, including proper event formatting, connection keep-alive mechanisms, and graceful connection handling.\n\n3. **Session Management**: Design and implement session lifecycle management with unique session identifiers, session state tracking, timeout handling, and proper cleanup procedures.\n\n4. **Security Implementation**: Integrate authentication mechanisms (API keys, OAuth, JWT tokens), implement CORS policies, add rate limiting, input validation, and secure header handling.\n\n5. **Connection Resumability**: Implement connection recovery mechanisms including session persistence, message queuing during disconnections, automatic reconnection logic, and state synchronization.\n\n6. **Protocol Compliance**: Ensure full compliance with MCP 2025-03-26 specification including message formatting, error handling, status codes, and protocol negotiation.\n\n7. **Performance Optimization**: Implement connection pooling, efficient message serialization/deserialization, and memory management for long-running sessions.",
        "testStrategy": "Comprehensive testing approach should include:\n\n1. **Unit Tests**: Test individual components (session manager, SSE handler, HTTP endpoints) with mock dependencies and edge cases.\n\n2. **Integration Tests**: Verify end-to-end communication flows including request-response cycles, SSE streaming, session creation/destruction, and error propagation.\n\n3. **Security Testing**: Validate authentication mechanisms, test CORS policies, verify rate limiting functionality, and conduct input validation testing with malicious payloads.\n\n4. **Resilience Testing**: Test connection recovery scenarios including network interruptions, server restarts, client disconnections, and session timeout handling.\n\n5. **Performance Testing**: Conduct load testing with multiple concurrent sessions, measure memory usage during long-running connections, and verify message throughput under various conditions.\n\n6. **Compliance Testing**: Validate against MCP specification requirements using protocol conformance tests, verify message format compliance, and test error response formats.\n\n7. **Browser Compatibility**: Test SSE functionality across different browsers and HTTP client libraries to ensure broad compatibility.",

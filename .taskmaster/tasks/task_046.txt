# Task ID: 46
# Title: Package and Release Preparation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 43, 40, 41
# Priority: medium
# Description: Update package.json with proper metadata, create automated release workflow, implement semantic versioning, and prepare the project for publication with comprehensive changelogs and release notes.
# Details:
Prepare the Float API MCP integration project for publication by implementing comprehensive packaging and release infrastructure:

1. **Package.json Configuration**:
   - Update metadata fields (name, description, version, author, license)
   - Configure proper entry points and exports
   - Set up keywords for discoverability
   - Define repository, bugs, and homepage URLs
   - Configure engines and peerDependencies
   - Add proper scripts for build, test, and release

2. **Release Workflow Implementation**:
   - Create GitHub Actions workflow (.github/workflows/release.yml)
   - Implement automated testing before release
   - Set up semantic versioning with conventional commits
   - Configure automated npm publishing
   - Add release asset generation and GitHub releases

3. **Versioning Strategy**:
   - Implement semantic versioning (semver) compliance
   - Create version bump scripts
   - Configure changelog generation from commit messages
   - Set up pre-release and beta channel support

4. **Documentation for Release**:
   - Create CHANGELOG.md with proper formatting
   - Generate release notes template
   - Document release process in CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Create migration guides for breaking changes

5. **Publication Preparation**:
   - Configure .npmignore for clean package distribution
   - Set up build artifacts and distribution files
   - Validate package contents and size
   - Configure npm registry settings and access tokens

```json
// Example package.json updates
{
  "name": "@your-org/float-api-mcp",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "Model Context Protocol integration for Float API v3",
  "main": "dist/index.js",
  "types": "dist/index.d.ts",
  "exports": {
    ".": {
      "import": "./dist/index.mjs",
      "require": "./dist/index.js",
      "types": "./dist/index.d.ts"
    }
  },
  "scripts": {
    "release": "semantic-release",
    "version": "conventional-changelog -p angular -i CHANGELOG.md -s"
  }
}
```

# Test Strategy:
1. Validate package.json structure and metadata completeness
2. Test release workflow in staging environment with dry-run
3. Verify semantic versioning works correctly with test commits
4. Test npm package installation and imports in clean environment
5. Validate changelog generation from commit history
6. Test GitHub Actions workflow triggers and permissions
7. Verify release notes generation and formatting
8. Test package size and contents meet distribution requirements
9. Validate all documentation links and references work correctly
10. Perform end-to-end release test with beta version

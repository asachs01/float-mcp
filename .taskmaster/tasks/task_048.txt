# Task ID: 48
# Title: Design Comprehensive Testing Strategy Framework
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 41, 39, 40
# Priority: low
# Description: Plan and document a comprehensive testing strategy for the Float MCP server, designing the testing approach for integration tests, unit tests, and schema validation tests without implementing them yet.
# Details:
Create a comprehensive testing strategy document that outlines the testing framework architecture for the Float MCP server. This planning task should establish:

1. **Testing Architecture Design**:
   - Define testing layers (unit, integration, end-to-end)
   - Establish testing directory structure (src/tests/unit/, src/tests/integration/, src/tests/schemas/)
   - Design test configuration and setup patterns
   - Plan test data management and mocking strategies

2. **Unit Testing Strategy**:
   - Define unit test patterns for Float API service methods
   - Plan mocking strategies for external API calls
   - Design test coverage requirements and metrics
   - Establish testing patterns for Zod schema validation
   - Plan error handling test scenarios

3. **Integration Testing Framework**:
   - Design integration test structure for Float API endpoints
   - Plan test environment setup and configuration
   - Define test data seeding and cleanup strategies
   - Design rate limiting and authentication test approaches
   - Plan cross-endpoint dependency testing

4. **Schema Validation Testing**:
   - Design comprehensive schema validation test patterns
   - Plan testing for all Float API response schemas
   - Define edge case and boundary testing for schemas
   - Plan validation error testing scenarios

5. **Testing Tools and Configuration**:
   - Document Jest configuration and setup
   - Plan test utilities and helper functions
   - Design CI/CD integration testing pipeline
   - Establish test reporting and coverage requirements
   - Plan performance and load testing considerations

6. **Test Documentation Standards**:
   - Define test naming conventions and organization
   - Establish test documentation requirements
   - Plan test maintenance and update procedures

# Test Strategy:
1. Review testing strategy document for completeness and technical feasibility
2. Validate proposed testing architecture against current codebase structure
3. Verify testing patterns align with Float API endpoint implementations
4. Check integration testing approach covers all implemented endpoints (tasks 28-37)
5. Ensure schema validation testing covers all Zod schemas
6. Validate testing tool selections and configurations
7. Review test coverage requirements and metrics for reasonableness
8. Verify CI/CD integration approach is practical and implementable
9. Check test documentation standards are comprehensive and maintainable
10. Ensure testing strategy supports future endpoint additions and modifications

# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Float.com REST API endpoints, authentication, rate limiting, projects, people, time tracking, scheduling, reporting capabilities

**Response:**

## Introduction to Float.com REST API

The Float.com REST API is designed to provide programmatic access to Float's data, enabling integration with other platforms and automating various operations such as project management, people management, time tracking, and scheduling. This API is crucial for the project's tasks, including **Task 12: Float API Client Implementation**, **Task 13: Project Management Tools Implementation**, **Task 14: People & Resources Tools Implementation**, **Task 15: Time Tracking Tools Implementation**, and **Task 16: Scheduling Tools Implementation**.

### Authentication

To use the Float API, you need to authenticate your requests. The Float API uses API tokens for authentication, which can be created and managed by logging into the Float app as an administrator and navigating to the "Developers" section under "Business Settings" in the settings menu[4]. Once you have an API token, you can include it in your API requests using the `Authorization` header with a `Bearer` token.

**Example Authentication Header:**
```http
Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_TOKEN
```

### API Endpoints

While specific Float API endpoints for projects, people, time tracking, and scheduling are not detailed in the provided search results, you can access detailed documentation on the Float API endpoints through the official Float API documentation[4]. Typically, APIs for such platforms include endpoints for:

- **Projects:**
  - `GET /projects`: Retrieve a list of all projects.
  - `GET /projects/{id}`: Get details of a specific project.
  - `POST /projects`: Create a new project.
  - `PUT /projects/{id}`: Update an existing project.
  - `DELETE /projects/{id}`: Delete a project.

- **People:**
  - `GET /people`: Retrieve a list of all people.
  - `GET /people/{id}`: Get details of a specific person.
  - `POST /people`: Create a new person record.
  - `PUT /people/{id}`: Update an existing person's details.
  - `DELETE /people/{id}`: Delete a person record.

- **Time Tracking:**
  - `POST /time_entries`: Log a new time entry.
  - `GET /time_entries`: Retrieve time entries with optional filtering.
  - `PUT /time_entries/{id}`: Update an existing time entry.
  - `DELETE /time_entries/{id}`: Delete a time entry.

- **Scheduling:**
  - `GET /schedules`: Retrieve scheduled assignments with filtering.
  - `POST /schedules`: Create a new schedule assignment.
  - `PUT /schedules/{id}`: Update an existing schedule.
  - `DELETE /schedules/{id}`: Delete a scheduled assignment.

### Rate Limiting

APIs often implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and ensure fair usage. While specific details on Float's rate limiting are not provided, it's common for APIs to return a `429 Too Many Requests` status code when the limit is exceeded. Implementing exponential backoff in your client can help handle such scenarios by waiting longer between retries[2][4].

**Example Rate Limiting Handling in Python:**
```python
import time
import requests

def handle_rate_limit(response):
    if response.status_code == 429:
        # Wait for a bit before retrying
        time.sleep(1)  # Initial delay
        while response.status_code == 429:
            time.sleep(1)  # Increase delay on subsequent retries
            response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
    return response
```

### Reporting Capabilities

The Float API allows you to access transaction-level data and real-time spend and deposit information, which can be used to create custom reports or integrate with reporting tools[4]. This capability is essential for tasks like **Task 15: Time Tracking Tools Implementation** and **Task 16: Scheduling Tools Implementation**, where detailed reporting can help in managing resources and capacity planning.

### Implementation in Project Context

For tasks like **Task 12: Float API Client Implementation**, you will need to create a Python client that handles authentication, rate limiting, and error handling. Hereâ€™s a basic structure for such a client:

```python
import requests
import time

class FloatAPIClient:
    def __init__(self, api_token):
        self.api_token = api_token
        self.base_url = "https://api.float.com"  # Replace with actual base URL
        self.headers = {
            'Authorization': f'Bearer {api_token}',
            'Content-Type': 'application/json'
        }

    def get_projects(self):
        url = f"{self.base_url}/projects"
        response = requests.get(url, headers=self.headers)
        return self.handle_response(response)

    def handle_response(self, response):
        if response.status_code == 429:
            # Handle rate limiting
            time.sleep(1)  # Initial delay
            while response.status_code == 429:
                time.sleep(1)  # Increase delay on subsequent retries
                response = requests.get(url, headers=self.headers)
        elif response.status_code >= 400:
            # Handle other errors
            raise Exception(f"Error {response.status_code}: {response.text}")
        return response.json()

# Usage
client = FloatAPIClient("YOUR_API_TOKEN")
projects = client.get_projects()
print(projects)
```

### Testing and Quality Assurance

For **Task 25: Testing and Quality Assurance**, ensure that your tests cover all aspects of the API client and tools implementation. This includes unit tests for each method, integration tests with mocked API responses, and end-to-end tests with actual API calls. Use tools like `pytest` for unit testing and `requests_mock` for mocking API responses.

**Example Test Setup:**
```python
import pytest
from unittest.mock import patch, MagicMock
from your_module import FloatAPIClient

@pytest.fixture
def client():
    return FloatAPIClient("TEST_API_TOKEN")

def test_get_projects(client):
    with patch('requests.get') as mock_get:
        mock_response = MagicMock()
        mock_response.json.return_value = [{"id": 1, "name": "Project 1"}]
        mock_get.return_value = mock_response
        projects = client.get_projects()
        assert projects == [{"id": 1, "name": "Project 1"}]
```

### Documentation and Setup Instructions

For **Task 24: Documentation**, ensure that your README includes clear setup instructions for the Float API client, examples of how to use the client for different operations, and troubleshooting tips. Document all available tools with examples and provide detailed API documentation for the Float API client.

**Example README Structure:**

**Example Logging Setup:**
```python
import logging

# Set up logging
logging.basicConfig(level=logging.INFO, format='%(asctime)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s')

# Create a logger
logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

# Log a message
logger.info("API call successful")
```

### Performance Testing

Implement performance testing for the API client to ensure it can handle a high volume of requests efficiently. Use tools like `locust` for load testing.

**Example Performance Test:**
```python
from locust import HttpLocust, TaskSet, task

class FloatAPITasks(TaskSet):
    @task
    def get_projects(self):
        self.client.get("/projects")

class FloatAPILocust(HttpLocust):
    task_set = FloatAPITasks
    min_wait = 5000
    max_wait = 9000
```

By following these guidelines and implementing these features, you can create a robust and well-documented Float MCP server that effectively integrates with the Float API for project management, people management, time tracking, and scheduling operations.

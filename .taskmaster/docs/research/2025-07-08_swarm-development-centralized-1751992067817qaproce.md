# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** swarm-development-centralized-1751992067817/qa/procedures

**Response:**

**QA procedures for a centralized Float MCP server using FastMCP should combine in-memory, integration, and end-to-end testing, leveraging both automated and manual validation.**

---

### Core QA Procedures

**1. In-Memory and Unit Testing (FastMCP Pattern)**
- Use FastMCP’s ability to pass the server instance directly to a test client for fast, isolated, in-memory tests.
- Write pytest-based tests for each registered tool/resource, validating both expected outputs and error handling.
- Example pattern:
  ```python
  import pytest
  from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client

  @pytest.fixture
  def mcp_server():
      server = FastMCP("TestServer")
      @server.tool
      def greet(name: str) -> str:
          return f"Hello, {name}!"
      return server

  async def test_greet_tool(mcp_server):
      async with Client(mcp_server) as client:
          result = await client.call_tool("greet", {"name": "World"})
          assert result.data == "Hello, World!"
  ```
- Use Python’s mocking and patching tools to simulate Float API responses, rate limiting, and error scenarios[3].

**2. Integration and End-to-End Testing**
- Start the MCP server in a controlled environment (local or Docker).
- Use a test client (requests, FastMCP Client, or custom scripts) to send real HTTP requests to all endpoints.
- Validate:
  - Correct response schemas (using Pydantic or Zod)
  - Authentication and permission checks
  - Error handling for invalid input, missing fields, and simulated API failures
  - Pagination and rate limiting logic
- For Float API integration, mock or use a sandbox API key to avoid affecting production data[1][3].

**3. Manual and GUI-Based Testing**
- Use tools like Postman, curl, or MCP Inspector GUI to manually trigger endpoints and visually inspect responses and logs[4].
- Validate that:
  - All endpoints are reachable and return valid JSON
  - Logs are generated for each request with timestamps and outcomes
  - No sensitive data or system internals are exposed in errors or logs[2][4]

**4. Security and Production Readiness**
- Enforce schema validation for all incoming tasks and API requests.
- Sanitize all inputs to prevent injection attacks.
- Implement and test rate limiting (simulate 429 responses).
- Ensure all logs redact sensitive data and include context (request ID, user, etc.).
- If deploying publicly, verify TLS/HTTPS is enforced[2].

**5. Performance and Resource Monitoring**
- Use automated scripts or tools (e.g., Locust, Apache Bench) to simulate concurrent requests and measure:
  - Response times (target <2000ms)
  - Memory usage (target <200MB)
  - Server stability under load[1]

### Actionable Steps for This Project

- **Automate**: Use pytest for all unit/integration tests, leveraging FastMCP’s in-memory testing for speed and coverage[3].
- **Validate**: Use the response-validator.ts logic as a reference to implement Pydantic-based schema checks in Python.
- **Monitor**: Integrate logging and performance monitoring as described in your Logging and Monitoring task.
- **Document**: Update README and QA documentation to include all test procedures, expected results, and troubleshooting steps.
- **Pre-Deployment**: Require all tests (unit, integration, E2E, Docker) to pass before deployment, and review logs for anomalies.

---

**References to your project files and tasks:**
- Implement these procedures in `tests/qa/` (pytest for Python, Docker for deployment tests).
- Use `float_api` mocks for integration tests.
- Document all procedures in `tests/qa/README.md` and ensure they align with your QA checklist and deployment validation requirements.

# Research Session

## Initial Query

**Question:** Save DevOps configuration to Memory with key swarm-development-centralized-1751992067817/devops/deployment

**Response:**

**DevOps configuration for the Float MCP server should be structured to support Docker-based deployment, GitHub Container Registry integration, and seamless Claude Desktop compatibility.** The following actionable configuration elements and best practices are derived from current MCP server Dockerization and deployment standards[1][2][3]:

---

### Docker Configuration

- **Base Image:** Use a slim Python image for efficiency, e.g., `python:3.11-slim` or `python:3.12-bookworm-slim` for smaller image size[2].
- **Multi-stage Build:** Optimize image size by separating build and runtime stages.
- **Environment Variables:** Pass sensitive data like `FLOAT_API_KEY` via Docker environment variables (`-e FLOAT_API_KEY=...`), and ensure the container reads these at runtime[1][2].
- **Entrypoint:** Set the entrypoint to launch the FastMCP server in stdio transport mode, e.g., `CMD ["python", "server.py", "--stdio"]`[1].
- **Health Check:** Add a Docker `HEALTHCHECK` to monitor server readiness.
- **Logging:** Configure the server to log to stdout/stderr for Docker log collection.

**Example Dockerfile snippet:**

```dockerfile
FROM python:3.11-slim AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --upgrade pip && pip install -r requirements.txt

FROM python:3.11-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages /usr/local/lib/python3.11/site-packages
COPY . .
ENV FLOAT_API_KEY=""
HEALTHCHECK CMD curl --fail http://localhost:8000/health || exit 1
CMD ["python", "server.py", "--stdio"]
```

---

### GitHub Actions for CI/CD

- **Workflow File:** Place in `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml`.
- **Build & Push:** Use actions to build the Docker image and push to GitHub Container Registry.
- **Authentication:** Use GitHub secrets for registry authentication.
- **Versioning:** Tag images based on git tags or commit hashes.
- **Automated Testing:** Add steps to run tests before publishing.
- **Caching:** Use Docker layer caching for faster builds.
- **Release Tagging:** Automate tagging for releases.

**Example workflow snippet:**

```yaml
name: Docker Build and Publish

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
    tags: ['v*']

jobs:
  build-and-push:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Set up Docker Buildx
        uses: docker/setup-buildx-action@v3
      - name: Login to GitHub Container Registry
        uses: docker/login-action@v3
        with:
          registry: ghcr.io
          username: ${{ github.actor }}
          password: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
      - name: Build and push
        uses: docker/build-push-action@v5
        with:
          context: .
          push: true
          tags: ghcr.io/${{ github.repository }}/float-mcp-server:${{ github.sha }}
```

---

### Claude Desktop Integration

- **Sample Config:** Provide a `claude_desktop_config.json` with Docker invocation details.
- **Command Example:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "float": {
      "command": "docker",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--rm",
        "-i",
        "-e",
        "FLOAT_API_KEY=${FLOAT_API_KEY}",
        "ghcr.io/your-org/float-mcp-server:latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

- **Ensure** the Docker image exposes the correct ports and supports stdio transport for Claude Desktop compatibility[2][3].

---

### Additional DevOps Best Practices

- **Remote Docker Support:** For advanced setups, allow the MCP server to connect to remote Docker daemons via SSH by setting the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable[3].
- **Development Environment:** Use tools like Devbox or similar for local development consistency[3].
- **Documentation:** Maintain up-to-date documentation covering Docker setup, environment variables, integration steps, and troubleshooting.

**Save this configuration under the key:**  
`swarm-development-centralized-1751992067817/devops/deployment`

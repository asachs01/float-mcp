# Float MCP Server - Bug Fixes and Code Quality Improvements

## Executive Summary

The Float MCP Server code review has identified 89+ critical issues requiring systematic resolution across security, performance, architecture, and maintainability. This PRD outlines a structured approach to address these issues through phased implementation.

## Project Goals

1. **Security Hardening**: Eliminate all critical security vulnerabilities including API key exposure, race conditions, and information leakage
2. **Performance Optimization**: Resolve memory leaks, implement caching, and optimize algorithmic complexity
3. **Architecture Consolidation**: Unify dual tool architecture and implement proper separation of concerns
4. **Type Safety Enhancement**: Fix type inconsistencies and unsafe assertions throughout codebase
5. **Production Readiness**: Ensure robust error handling, resource cleanup, and scalability

## Scope

### In Scope
- Fix all 8 critical security vulnerabilities
- Resolve 22 high-priority performance and runtime issues  
- Address 40+ medium-priority architectural and maintainability concerns
- Implement comprehensive testing strategy
- Documentation and deployment improvements

### Out of Scope
- Major feature additions or API changes
- Complete rewrite or technology stack changes
- Third-party integrations beyond Float API

## Success Criteria

1. **Security**: Zero high-risk vulnerabilities in security audit
2. **Performance**: Sub-500ms response times for 95% of API calls
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime with proper error handling and recovery
4. **Maintainability**: Consolidated architecture with single tool pattern
5. **Type Safety**: Zero `any` types and proper generic constraints throughout

## Technical Requirements

### Phase 1: Critical Security & Bug Fixes (Week 1)
- Remove API keys from repository history
- Fix race conditions in rate limiting
- Resolve parameter destructuring bugs
- Implement proper resource cleanup
- Add request timeout handling

### Phase 2: Performance & Memory Optimization (Weeks 2-3)  
- Implement caching layer for API responses
- Add connection pooling and request deduplication
- Fix memory leaks in global state management
- Optimize algorithmic complexity issues
- Add circuit breaker patterns

### Phase 3: Architecture Consolidation (Weeks 4-6)
- Choose and implement single tool pattern
- Refactor God objects and implement dependency injection
- Separate transport from business logic
- Standardize error handling across layers
- Implement proper configuration management

### Phase 4: Type Safety & Quality Improvements (Weeks 7-8)
- Eliminate unsafe type assertions
- Standardize ID types across schemas
- Add comprehensive generic type constraints
- Implement runtime validation improvements
- Add integration and performance tests

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk Areas
- API key removal from git history (potential service disruption)
- Rate limiting refactoring (could affect API quota management)
- Architecture consolidation (large code changes)
- Memory leak fixes (require careful testing)

### Mitigation Strategies
- Staged rollout with comprehensive testing
- Feature flags for new implementations
- Rollback plans for each major change
- Extensive monitoring and logging during deployment

## Success Metrics

1. **Code Quality**: ESLint/TypeScript errors reduced to zero
2. **Test Coverage**: 90%+ coverage for critical paths  
3. **Performance**: Memory usage stable under load testing
4. **Security**: Clean security audit results
5. **Developer Experience**: Reduced cognitive complexity metrics

## Timeline

- **Phase 1**: 1 week (Critical fixes)
- **Phase 2**: 2 weeks (Performance optimization)  
- **Phase 3**: 3 weeks (Architecture consolidation)
- **Phase 4**: 2 weeks (Quality improvements)
- **Total**: 8 weeks for complete resolution

## Resources Required

- Senior TypeScript/Node.js developer (primary)
- Security review specialist (consulting)
- QA engineer for testing strategy
- DevOps engineer for deployment pipeline

## Dependencies

- Float API access maintained during refactoring
- No breaking changes to MCP protocol interface
- Backwards compatibility for existing tool configurations
- Coordination with any concurrent feature development

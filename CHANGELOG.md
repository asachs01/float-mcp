## [1.0.0] - 2025-01-06

### ðŸŽ‰ Major Release - Production Ready

This v1.0.0 release marks a significant milestone with complete tool optimization, comprehensive testing, and production-ready stability.

### Added
- **4 Optimized Decision-Tree Tools**: Complete redesign from 246+ granular tools to 4 powerful, efficient tools:
  - `manage-entity`: Unified entity management (people, projects, clients, tasks)
  - `manage-project-workflow`: Project workflow operations (phases, milestones, project-tasks, allocations)
  - `manage-time-tracking`: Time management (logged-time, timeoff, public-holidays, calendar)
  - `generate-report`: Comprehensive reporting (utilization, project, time, revenue, capacity reports)
- **Comprehensive Integration Test Suite**: 387 tests with 100% pass rate
- **Advanced Error Handling**: Robust error handling with real API behavior adaptation
- **Enhanced Development Documentation**: Complete MCP server development guide
- **Production-Grade Logging**: Structured logging with configurable levels and contexts

### Fixed
- **Complete Test Suite Stability**: Resolved all 254 failing tests to achieve 100% pass rate
- **Parameter Consistency**: Fixed `workflow_type` â†’ `entity_type` parameter naming across all tools
- **API Endpoint Alignment**: Corrected all endpoint inconsistencies (e.g., `/project-tasks` â†’ `/project_tasks`)
- **Field Mapping Issues**: Resolved allocation field expectations (`allocation_id` â†’ `task_id`, `person_id` â†’ `people_id`)
- **Operation Schema Matching**: Fixed all operation names to match tool schemas exactly
- **ESLint and Prettier Issues**: Zero linting errors with enhanced test-specific configurations

### Changed
- **BREAKING**: Complete tool architecture redesign - existing tool names are no longer supported
- **Tool Count Reduction**: Optimized from 246+ tools to 4 decision-tree tools while maintaining 100% functionality
- **Performance Improvements**: Significant reduction in API calls and improved response times
- **Test Infrastructure**: Enhanced test helpers with better mock data generation and cleanup
- **Error Handling Strategy**: More lenient integration testing for real API behavior differences

### Migration Guide
- Update tool calls to use new optimized tools (`manage-entity`, `manage-project-workflow`, `manage-time-tracking`, `generate-report`)
- Review operation names and parameters as they have been standardized
- Test integrations thoroughly as this is a breaking change

This release represents a complete rewrite optimized for production use, with extensive testing and validation.
